# Ani 📝
## An iOS Note-taking App for people with extraordinary minds (like me) 

Currently in the `design phase`, this App will be a passion project of mine, with the hope to build & ship something I own.
The idea sprouted 🌱 from my love of colour coding & list making. I am constantly making new lists with different emoji's that express the importance of the items 💥.

The name 'Ani' steams from the word `Anxiety` 🤯 & `type A personality`. Wanting to create an App that I'll enjoy using in my day-to-day, I hope others will enjoy it too.

Whilst there's not much to see here just yet... Please come back in a year (Nov 2024) hopefully, by then, there will be A LOT more to see.
